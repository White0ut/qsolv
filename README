Tests
	Each unit test is setup by setting a,b and c, sending the mock object the square root to pass to the qsolve function, calling qsolv and asking for what was sent to the mock object.

 	Then each unit test asserts the following values to check for the correct value 
	checks value sent to the mock object
	checks the return value of qsolve
	checks the value of both for the roots calculated

	The above is repeated for the qsolve function with no mock object

	Functional test are run be redirecting input to the application and running diff on the output compared against a correct input file.

	(All test output is logged in a log file under the test directory)

Mock Object
	The mock object simply hands the qsolv function the square root value it was setup with.

	The file is named sqrtmock.c
