Typescript
	The typescript is of the unit tests being run on qsolv

	The file is named mockQsolveTests.log

Unit Tests
	Each unit test is setup by setting a,b and c, sending the mock object the square root to pass to the qsolve function, calling qsolv and asking for what was sent to the mock object.

 	Then each unit test asserts the following values to check for the correct value 
	checks value sent to the mock object
	checks the return value of qsolve
	checks the value of both for the roots calculated

	The file is named test.c

Mock Object
	The mock object simply hands the qsolv function the square root value it was setup with.

	The file is named sqrtmock.c
